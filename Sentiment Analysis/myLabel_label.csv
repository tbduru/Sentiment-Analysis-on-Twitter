960,"@brisbanetimes If as you say Putin's war is a military debacle why are bordering NATO European states bolstering their defences? If they can't defeat a basket case country like Ukrain how on earth are they expected to defeat NATO nations? Couldn't have anything to do with arms sales, could it?"
961,@helenaehealy @Broughton68 @SobolLubov Basicaly roach says that we(he and Putin) started war first as intelligence knew that Ukrain will strike first. Ukrain planned to strike forces that were on the drills across the border. There are 4 positions where they supposed to strike from. And also bio weapons and blabla

982,@RT_com Putin is losing the war against Ukrain lol. The weak Russian army is being defeated by the hero Ukrainian troops and being pushed back. They also blew up a troop ship lol. Tell the weak Putin to pull his troops out and go home and never go back to Ukrain to be defeated again.
983,@RT_com Hahaha Russia is losing the war  One of your troop ships got blown up.  Russian army is weak and rubbish  Poor weak  Putin is losing the war he should send all his troops back to Russia and never go back to Ukrain because he will be defeated again
984,"4/6
like Hitler tried with Jews. Ironically, Ukrain President is a Jew!

The end of the war will be Putin's victory, pyrrhic though it might seem initially. But the long term gains will be huge.

This end could be before end of next year 2023. Maybe 2024 max.

5) we will take Pok, pakistan disintegrate.."
988,@Ukrain_War if Putin is willing to kill 330 innocent people 186 were children that burned to death just to kill the 31 Chechen hostage takers in the botched Beslan school siege.. Shows that his own people are expendable he will use nuclear weapons instead of admitting he failed again
